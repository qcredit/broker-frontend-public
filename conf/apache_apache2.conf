# HostnameLookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP addresses
# e.g., www.apache.org (on) or 204.62.129.132 (off).

# ErrorLog: The location of the error log file.
# If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a <VirtualHost>

# container, that host's errors will be logged there and not here.

# The former is used by web applications packaged in Debian,

# your system is serving content from a sub-directory in /srv you must allow
# access here, or in any related virtual host.
